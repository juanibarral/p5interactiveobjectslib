        <h3>Welcome to P5 Visual Analytics Library.</h3>

<p>This is a interactive objects library written in Java over <a href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a>. The main feature is that the elements have their own feedback and are optimized to be drawn only when necessary.
<br>All the objects extends a base object called PickeableObject that has 2 basic states: selected and unselected. Depending on its state the object will be drawn in a different way.
</p>

<h3>Pickeable Object</h3>
<p>
	It is the base for the interactive objects. It is an abstract class that has all the functionality for the interactive object.
	It has two main states: <b>selected</b> and <b>unselected</b> which are set depending if the mouse is over the object or not. 
	Also each object launch events depending on its state. Finally, an object has an attribute that tells if the object has changed or not.	
</p>

<h4>Array of Pickeable Objects</h4>
<p>
	When there is more than one pickeable object, it is necessary to know when to draw the objects and when not. The objects must be drawn
	when at least one of the objects has changed. In order to facilitate the workflow of the flags necessary to choose when or not to draw, there is the <b>PickeableObjectArray</b>.
	<br> This object works as a container and has a method draw() which is in charge of calling the object's drawing methods if necessary. 
</p>
<h3>Basic Elements</h3>

<p>There are simple elements to use as well as complete plots with whole funcionality.
	<ul>
		<li> <a href="point.html">Point</a>
		<li> <a href="parallelCordinatesPlot.html">Parallel Coordinates Plot</a>
		<li> <a href="dandelionPlot.html">Dandelion Plot</a>
	</ul>
